    <p>Programming is currently one of the most demanded professions by companies and startups around the world that are looking for talent to form areas that drive innovative advances within their organizations, from writing code to verifying its functioning.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="What_should_you_know_before_you_start_programming?"><header><strong><font size="6">What should you know before you start programming?</font></strong></header>
    
    <p>To learn about the world of programming, you must bear in mind that, although it is an opportunity to delve into technology, mastering languages ​​can be complicated at first.

<br>

However, once you understand the mechanism and the programming processes, that is, the step by step to carry out a particular project, things begin to flow much more.



You will be able to solve problems using a sequence of steps known as algorithms, being responsible for creating recipes that you will later have to translate into existing programming languages.

<br></br>

Algorithms will guide you through the planning process to solve a problem as efficiently as possible.



Another point that you should keep in mind is the difference between backend and frontend, if you are going to focus on web development.

<br></br>

By backend we mean the entire internal part behind a website, which makes each one of them work correctly. It is responsible for selecting, processing and sending data to users. Additionally, it performs all database queries that are connected to the server.



This type of phases is constantly updated. Therefore, the person in charge of this area must ensure an optimal and immediate response of the site that is operating.



For its part, a frontend deals with the interface that we all see while we are browsing; for example, this article you are reading right now is part of that area.



It is the creative part of all web design since points such as colors, fonts, images and all those resources that make navigation interactive for the user must be taken into account.

<br></br>

Every programmer who is responsible for fully exploiting this phase must use the following elements:

<ol>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong>, es un lenguaje de hipertexto que tiene como objetivo dar instrucciones al navegador acerca de cómo es la estructura y el contenido</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>CSS</strong>, es también un lenguaje, pero este se usa para maquetar y determinar el diseño que se utilizará en la interfaz</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>, tiene la tarea de aportar funcionalidad y animación a las secciones que se desarrollen para el sitio web</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <p>Once you understand what world you are going to face, another process begins: that of terminologies.


<br></br>

<p>That is why it seems important to us that you recognize the concepts that you will find when you are in the process of training as a programmer since these will be part of the day to day of what your profession will be. Pay attention!</p>

    <header><strong><font size="6">Programming Basics</font></strong></header>
    <p>When you are in the training process, you will find a wide terminology that will help you to understand much better all the work of programming. We anticipate those concepts that you will see more frequently:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Algorithms</strong>: It is a sequence of commands independent of programming languages. They determine not only the design of the program but also the codes to be executed. Algorithms are very important when programming and you must keep in mind that they are finite, defined and precise.
</li>
      <br>
    <li><strong>Variables and vectors</strong>: The first are all those spaces that gather specific data and the second are compound variables. Both terms form strings of information that are stored in an assigned variable.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>: They are similar to variables, the difference is that functions contain code and are designed to avoid repetition of code fragments. Especially for those people who are learning to program.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Conditional</strong>: They are responsible for meeting the requirements for the execution of web development in general.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Loops</strong>: They act like conditionals, only they are executed constantly. Once the condition of the program is fulfilled, the loop will continue its operation.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Syntax</strong>: It is all visual representation of programming languages. Here you can see the sequences, the order of the codes so that the program runs in the most optimal and functional way.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Extra information</h4>

<p>The HTML <code>button</code> tag defines a clickable button.</p>

<p>The CSS <code>background-color</code> property defines the background color of an element.</p>
  
<p>The HTML <code>input</code> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.</p>
<p>The HTML <code>em</code> tag is used to define emphasized text.</p>

<p>The CSS <code>Pseudo-class</code> cis used to define a special state of an element.</p>

    <p>To learn programming you need to keep in mind that this is not a process that will take you one or two days. Programming requires constant learning to achieve future goals.

<br></br>

Our intention is not to discourage you, on the contrary, the idea is for you to be clear that, to be a successful programmer, constant training is required. We are here to accompany you in that process!

<br></br>

Why do we emphasize this? Because programming requires the learning of many elements, several of them are based on the type of languages ​​you decide to learn, added to the wide variety of concepts, some of them we have already introduced to you.

<br></br>

Also, variations and database applications. This is such a changing environment that, many times, makes the student feel overwhelmed with so much information received.

<br></br>

To learn programming you can choose these alternatives:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Self-study learning</strong>: Here people discover how to program for themselves. Books or notes will help to immerse yourself in the universe of digital data. It is not a bad option for those who love learning freely and on their own.</li>

  <li><strong>Academic learning</strong>: It is the one that is taught by an institution through courses or careers, webinars that are carried out in a guided way. You must take into account the content and the didactic material that will be given to you to begin the learning process. The modality you select will depend directly on your tastes to study and receive classes. One of the advantages of this type of learning is that you will have the opportunity to share experiences with other students about the process they are going through together, so queries and doubts can be in groups and will help you answer them all.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to program with trusted websites</strong>: There are sites that help those interested in programming with free or paid content to learn. These are becoming the most far-reaching alternatives for those interested in this area.
  </li>
<li><strong>Study computer science</strong>: This is, for many, one of the best alternatives if you want to learn to program. Not to say that the above are bad ideas, just that this would be a formal formation. You should keep in mind that it is a dedication for several years and full time.
</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As you can see, there are several options for you to immerse yourself in the universe of programming. A profession that is giving a lot to talk about lately. For this reason, we give you some recommendations so that you can start your training with firm steps.</p>

    <p>The interest of many people to learn programming is growing rapidly. While some begin their journey, few actually make it.

<br></br>

For that reason, we give you four basic recommendations because we really want you to reach the goal of being a professional programmer.

<br></br>

Remember that this is not a skill that you will learn overnight, it requires a lot of commitment, responsibility and attention. You can achieve it without knowing anything about the subject, you just need the desire to learn and always keep in mind that programming is based on a set of instructions that is given to a computer to carry out an action, taking into account that premise, you can develop everything.

<br></br>

So, the four recommendations that we give you are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Study English</strong>: When you are starting the training you will realize that most of the theory comes from bibliographies that are in that language, that is where the root of this profession comes from. If you master it, excellent, you already have a great path gained; but, if the opposite happens, you should pay attention to this tool that will be very useful for the study process.
</li>
<li><strong>Select a programming language</strong>: Learning programming means becoming familiar with and mastering a particular language with great skill, since if in the future you need or want to start with another, learning will be much easier. Java is the best known, but there are other alternatives with which you can develop your skills as a professional programmer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not start programming without having knowledge</strong>: This can be a blunder. A waste of time that will get you nowhere. It is recommended that you have some knowledge or fundamentals of programming that will allow you to obtain positive results throughout your process.</li>
<li><strong>Practice programming</strong>: This profession requires constant learning, trial and error, and always being up-to-date with the technological trends in the area because they are changing repeatedly. It is also a way to guarantee everything you have learned and putting it into practice will help you take on projects with the results you want.
</li>
  </ol>

Learning programming doesn't have to be boring and tedious, instead it can be a great invitation to have fun.</p>


Keep reading because we share some tools with which you can even study with the youngest members of the household, and spend a good number of hours learning and playing.</p>

<h3>Scratch</h3>
<p>It is a programming language in a free service developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is an opportunity for children to learn programming, develop their own animations, games and stories.

<br>

In Scratch they will also be able to create digital communities to interact with people from all over the world.</p>

<h3>Blocky</h3>
<p>For some specialists, this tool is the most elegant version of Scratch because it was made by Google. Although it uses the same block construction logic, in Blocky children will be able to export codes in various languages ​​such as JavaScript, Python, PHP, among others.

<br>

It is a comprehensive and didactic training tool that will provide the knowledge needed for the area.</p>

<h3>Etoys</h3>
<p>Without a doubt, this is the easiest tool to use since learning is done through games, models and stories, giving children the possibility of learning in a more didactic and interactive way.
<br>


In Etoys you will find graphics, animated objects, music, sound and text. The most important thing is that the license to use is free.</p>
